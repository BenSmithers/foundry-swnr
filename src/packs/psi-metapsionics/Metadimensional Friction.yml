    <p>As a Main Action, the metapsion Commits Effort for the scene to create
    localized MES turbulence around a visible target psychic within 200 meters.
    Each time the target Commits Effort or an NPC initiates a psychic power,
    they suffer 1d8 damage per Metapsionics skill level of the adept. Each time
    the target suffers the damage they can attempt a Mental saving throw to
    throw off the effect. It lasts no longer than the rest of the scene at most.
    Only one application of this friction can affect a target at once.</p>
