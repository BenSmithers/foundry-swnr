  description: >-
    Stun batons are common law enforcement tools. The damage they do can drop a
    target to zero hit points, but will not kill them, the victim awakening in
    ten minutes with one hit point. Stun batons trickle-charge from normal
    movement and will not run out of electrical energy under normal use
    conditions.
