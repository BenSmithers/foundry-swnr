name: Thermal Pistol
type: weapon
data:
  description: Thermal pistols and their larger, two-handed plasma projector cousins replace the beam of a laser with a small sphere of magnetically-shaped plasma. The spheres tend to dissipate at much shorter ranges than a laser beam, but do significantly more damage to targets within range and are not affected by ambient particulates. They tend to be extremely loud in operation.
