name: Distortion Cannon
type: weapon
data:
  description: Distortion cannons are among the most sophisticated man-portable weapons designed before the Scream. These two-handed energy weapons rely on the same principle as does a spike drive, manipulating the underlying fabric of space to disrupt a target. Provided the wielder can see a target within range or accurately fix its location within one meter, the distortion cannon can ignore up to one meter of solid cover between the gun and its target
