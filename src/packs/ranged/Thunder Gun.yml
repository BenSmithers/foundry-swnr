name: Thunder Gun
type: weapon
data:
  description: Thunder guns are named for the basso vibrations caused by their operation, a sound that can be felt as far as thirty meters away from an operator. This two-handed weapon uses grav plates to create rapid, randomized disruptions in a target that increase the chance of complete structural collapse. If a thunder gun hits a target with an unmodified hit roll of 16 or higher an extra 1d10 damage is rolled. This bonus damage always applies to inanimate targets.
