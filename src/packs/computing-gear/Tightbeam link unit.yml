    Tightbeam link unit: Much like a remote link unit, a tightbeam unit uses a
    laser to connect via lineof-sight transmission. Unlike a remote link unit,
    thereâ€™s almost no chance for a conventional security system to detect this
    link, but it requires that the infiltrators get a clear line of sight
    between the unit and the receiving end. Commercial satellite reception units
    can be employed for skyward aiming at 500 credits/hour if a second land unit
    is unavailable, but indoor use is impossible.
