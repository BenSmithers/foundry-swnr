  description: >-
    Demo Charges are the general run of placed explosives beloved of terrorists
    and adventurers the world over. The usual variety can be detonated by radio
    signals, timers, or electrical charges, and inflict their damage on any
    objects within twenty meters, with an Evasion saving throw for half damage.
    Victims within forty meters take half damage, with an Evasion save for none.
    The charge is sufficient to blow a four-meter wide hole in anything short of
    a reinforced wall. PCs with a background in demolitions or Fix-0 skill can
    shape the charge so it directs the blast in only one direction, sparing all
    but two meters of the rest.
