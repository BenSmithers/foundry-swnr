  description: >-
    Vortex cannons use controlled gravitic shear planes to cause a target to
    simply fall apart into component fragments. The cannons are silent in
    operation, but so heavy and complex that they can only be mounted on
    gravtanks and other similar dedicated fighting vehicles.
