  description: >-
    Rocket launchers cover a wide variety of man-portable missile launchers of
    varying degrees of sophistication. The weapons are usually equipped with
    basic tracking sensors, but are of limited accuracy against human-sized
    targets. Rocket launchers take a 04 hit penalty against targets of human
    size or smaller. Unlike most Heavy weapons, rocket launchers can be
    shoulder-fired without a prepared emplacement to support them.
