  description: >-
    This craft is a conventional civilian shuttle, albeit one
    with a spike drive sufficient to get it to a neighboring
    system and enough passenger space to make it a minimally-acceptable transport for brave VIPs and light
    cargo. If used as an inter-system transport, however, at
    least three crew will be needed to safely navigate a drill.
    While cheap and flexible, the shuttle is entirely
    unarmed and acutely vulnerable to piracy or hostile
    warships. In such cases the pilot’s only recourse is to
    surrender or hope the small craft’s nimble maneuver
    drives can keep it away from the attacker long enough
    to get to safety.

        Stepped tapping of the spike drive power plant
        allows for the emission of a torrent of charged
        particles. The particles have very little armor
        penetration, but can fry a small ship's power grid
        in a strike or two.

        This fitting must be put in place when the ship is built,
        and cannot be installed on cruiser-class or larger ships.
        A ship designed for atmospheric flight can land on most
        solid or aqueous surfaces.
