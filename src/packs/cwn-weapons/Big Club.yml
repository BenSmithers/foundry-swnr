  description: "Knives, clubs, swords, and other simple melee weap- ons are available\
    \ almost anywhere on the street. Par- ticularly impoverished gangers sometimes\
    \ fashion makeshift machetes and improvised shivs when better can\u2019t be obtained.\
    \ Such weapons are effectively free, but have a -1 penalty to hit and damage rolls\
    \ due to their ungainly make. This is a two-handed weapon, making it impossible\
    \ to have a Readied item in the user's off-hand"
