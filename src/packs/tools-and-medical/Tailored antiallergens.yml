    Tailored Antiallergens: A dose of tailored antiallergens can be used to
    render a local worldâ€™s organics largely edible by humans and its atmosphere
    breathable without severe allergic reactions. While many worlds have been
    seeded with Terran life forms or have produced organics that are edible by
    humans, others are toxic without the appropriate chemical augmentation. A
    dose of these antiallergens lasts for twenty-four hours.
