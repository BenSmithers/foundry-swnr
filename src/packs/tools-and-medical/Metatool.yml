    Metatool: This wrist-mounted housing contains a myriad of small, useful
    tools designed to handle the widest possible range of technical needs. While
    a metatool is too limited to handle major jobs, it is usually sufficient to
    manage jury-rigged repairs and temporary fixes until the tech has time to
    apply a larger wrench to the problem.
