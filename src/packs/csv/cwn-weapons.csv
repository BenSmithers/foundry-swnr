Light Pistol,200,1d6,false,0,0,10,80,"ammo",false,false,15,15,"dex",,1,1d8,2,"Light and heavy pistols are categorized by the caliber of the bullet they fire. Some operators prefer the low recoil and high mag capacity possible with a low-caliber round, while others like to have a little more certainty in dropping the targets they hit."
Knife,20,1d4,false,1,15,10,20,"none",false,false,0,0,"str","dex",1,1d6,3,"Knives, clubs, swords, and other simple melee weap- ons are available almost anywhere on the street. Par- ticularly impoverished gangers sometimes fashion makeshift machetes and improvised shivs when better canâ€™t be obtained. Such weapons are effectively free, but have a -1 penalty to hit and damage rolls due to their ungainly make."
Anti-Materiel Rifle,8000,3d8,false,0,0,1000,2000,"special",false,false,5,5,"dex",,3,1d12,3,"Anti-materiel rifles have encountered something of a renaissance with the ubiquity of armored drones and heavily cybered combatants. While not suitable for downing tanks or other heavily armored vehicles, their 20mm rounds are more than sufficient to punch through lighter armor plating, concrete walls, and full body conversion cyborgs. Use of a secure firing rest is recommended for best results."
