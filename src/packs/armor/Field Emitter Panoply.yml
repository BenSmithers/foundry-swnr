data:
  description: >-
    A field emitter panoply is a heavy-duty pretech defensive system composed of
    a half-dozen worn emitter nodes that sheath the wearer in a nimbus of
    close-fitting damper fields. The FEP’s pale glow is obvious, but it provides
    all the benefits of storm armor with no power source required. The FEP is
    particularly effective at filtering radiation, and renders the wearer immune
    to any dose that wouldn’t kill them in seconds. Many FEPs project
    intimidating holographic skins over the wearer when in operation.
