  description: >-
    A “vestimentum” is a catch-all term for one of the many ancient Mandate
    ceremonial armors meant chiefly for parade guards, ritual officiants,
    cultural reenactors, or other roles that put elaborate style at a premium.
    While these outfits often look wildly unmilitary, their hyper-advanced
    components and micronized force fields give them the same protection against
    primitive weapons as any other powered armor.
