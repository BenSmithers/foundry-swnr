  description: "One set of manipulators is added to the drone, whether a mechanical\
    \ claw, an \narticulated metal tendril, or some other device.\nWith a Main Action\
    \ command from the pilot, it\n can function as a single human hand with an effective\
    \ Strength of 12, but it cannot effectively\n be used for an attack or to lift\
    \ anything heavier \nthan the drone itself. The fitting can carry things \nfor\
    \ short distances, but to haul weight any real\n distance the Cargo Space fitting\
    \ is required. This \nfitting can be added more than once if a pair of\n \u201C\
    hands\u201D are needed."
