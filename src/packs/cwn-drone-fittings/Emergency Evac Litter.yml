  description: "Functioning only for groundbased drones of Enc 3 or greater, the drone\
    \ is equipped with a retractable litter that can fit one human patient, along\
    \ with manipulators sufficient to get a prone victim onto the litter with\n a\
    \ Main Action. Onboard meds allow for remote \nHeal skill checks to stabilize\
    \ a Mortally Wounded\n target, with one attempt allowed as part of the \nloading\
    \ action. A loaded patient can\u2019t be harmed \nuntil the drone is destroyed\
    \ or opens the litter,\n but if the drone dies, the patient does too. As a \n\
    Main Action, the drone can be ordered to autonomously take the patient to a particular\
    \ location. \nAs an On Turn action, an onboard transmitter\ncan also place a call\
    \ for medical assistance to a \npre-arranged number."
