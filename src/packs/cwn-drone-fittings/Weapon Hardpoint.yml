  description: "Drones that are not factory-equipped with weapon hardpoints can have\n\
    \ one worked in as an aftermarket addition. The\n usual hardpoint limits on maximum\
    \ allowed\n weapon size still apply, however, and this fitting \ncounts as two\
    \ for purposes of the drone\u2019s maximum fittings."
