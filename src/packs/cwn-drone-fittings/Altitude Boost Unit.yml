  description: "Most flying drones have an effective ceiling of 1,000 meters if there\
    \ are no scramblers to lessen the effective control range. This unit increases\
    \ a flying drone\u2019s maximum altitude to 5,000 meters, making most effectively\
    \ invisible to ordinary sight. Such height does, however, make it extremely conspicuous\
    \ to aerial scanners used by city law enforcement and high-security corp buildings.\
    \ The speed of their response will depend on the drone\u2019s apparent threat."
